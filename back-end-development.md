[C# Advanced (Microsoft-youtube.com)](https://www.youtube.com/playlist?list=PLdo4fOcmZ0oXzJ3FC-ApBes-0klFN9kr9 "C# Advanced - LINQ SERIES: Language Integrated Query, LINQ, provides a consistent syntax to query any data source. More than that, the compiler and libraries translate that consistent syntax to native queries for each different data source. You learn LINQ, and you can efficiently access data from databases, cloud storage, objects in memory, JSON or XML data sources. In this series, you’ll learn how to write LINQ queries. You’ll also learn about the mechanisms LINQ uses to translate your C# code into native queries for specific data sources. ASYNC SERIES: Modern applications require asynchronous processing. You may make network calls to services in the cloud or on other machines. You may be starting long-running processes to analyze large data sets. The C# language has features that make async programs easier to reason about and understand. In this series, you’ll learn about “async” and “await”, and the Task class. You’ll learn how these features work together to help you to write asynchronous applications.")
